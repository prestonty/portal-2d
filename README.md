# portal-2d
ICS4U final project. Made 2d portal using projectile motion from grade 12 physics. Programmed using Java and supports mouse and keyboard for aiming and movement.

I have plans to improve this game as I had to rush this project (I was afraid of my exams). I will fix the collision and will make the projectiles feel precise and nicer to use
