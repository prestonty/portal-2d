Samus' current vertical is 105 she can comfortably jump over 2 blocks)
^ initial yVel = 15

spin ball is 64 by 64
When initial yVel = 12, vertical is 66
Max height is about 160 (but her hitbox gets reduced when she goes into a ball so chill
Max height is actually 130 on the dot. Landing max height is 66-


need to reduce by a bit
Samus is 90 px tall
So about 200px at max height

each tile is 50px by 50px
1600 by 1200 (maybe increase height (nah)

1600/50 = 32 tiles
1200/50 = 24 tiles

good game design
by making the room bigger, player can move cooler
and also, i can make the portals necessary to beat the game

Legend:
x is a tile
b is a button. Must press button to unlock door (door changes from red to green when unlocked)
space is free space
pressurePlate
p is portalable tile
d is door to next room
r is a ray. Portals cannot pass the ray but players can

Tips:
make every floor at least 3 tiles tall (samus has room to jump but may bang head)
for button make a method where objects with mass (not portal projectiles)
can activate it
if it detects an object with mass pushing on it, will open door
else, close door if no mass on it not going to have cubes since u need to pick it up!!!

CREATE NEW BLOCK WHERE U CAN SHOOT PORTALS THROUGH BUT PLAYER CANNOT MOVE THROUGH!!!
